# Crime Scene Learning Hub 🕵️‍♀️

Crime Scene Learning Hub is an open-source Flutter application that helps users learn **complex technical and system concepts** through a **crime investigation metaphor**.  
Instead of traditional explanations, each topic is presented as a **case** with suspects, evidence, and a final verdict—making learning more engaging, intuitive, and memorable.

## Concept

Many learners struggle with abstract topics like deadlocks, system failures, or design flaws.  
Crime Scene Learning Hub simplifies these concepts by treating them as **investigation cases**, where users analyze clues, identify suspects, and reach logical conclusions.

## App Structure

The app is divided into **three main sections**:

### 1. Explore Cases 🔍

This section focuses on **learning and understanding concepts**.

**What it includes:**
- A list of case files (e.g., Deadlock in Multithreading, Deadlock in Databases, etc.)
- Category-based filtering (OS, DBMS, CN, etc.)
- Each case is structured as:
  - **Suspects** – possible causes or components involved  
  - **Evidence** – symptoms, observations, and technical clues  
  - **Final Verdict** – clear explanation of the root cause and solution  

This storytelling approach helps users understand *why* a problem happens, not just *what* it is.

### 2. Solve a Case 🧩

This section focuses on **testing understanding**.

**How it works:**
- Users are given a case-based quiz
- Each case contains **4–5 questions**, such as:
  - Identify the suspect  
  - Find the system flaw  
  - Choose the correct execution/order  
- Questions are evaluated as **right or wrong**
- Helps reinforce learning through application
