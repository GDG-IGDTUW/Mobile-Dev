Recipe Finder is designed to make cooking easier and more enjoyable. Users can input ingredients they have, and the app displays recipes they can prepare.

   - Allows users to input the ingredients they have.  
   - Includes a "Search" button to fetch recipes.  

3. **Recipe Display Screen:**  
   - Displays recipes based on the provided ingredients.  
   - Each recipe is shown with its title, thumbnail, and a "View Recipe Details" button for detailed instructions.
